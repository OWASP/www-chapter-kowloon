## OWASP Kowloon
OWASP Kowloon was found in 2021 September. We aim to provide a platform for young programmers and start-ups to exchange ideas on how to protect their web applications. 

Come along with the digital transformation, the importance of cybersecurity are now the duty of all developers, and business owner. We focus on the training and information sharing on the DevSecOps use case.

As a young start-up who will be the future leader of our world, we hope to raise the security awareness of web applications among the community. 

We also aim to provide active community help to those start-ups who want to implement a better code standard.
